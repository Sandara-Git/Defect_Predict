# Defect_Predict

### Assumptions 
Assume that historical data is a good indicator of future defects.

Assume that the chosen features are sufficient for defect prediction.

### Data sets

In this experiment, I have used open source publicly available data from PROMISE Software Engineering Database

### Why Machine Learning

Early Detection: Machine learning models can analyze patterns and historical data to identify potential defects in the early stages of the software development lifecycle.

Cost Savings: Identifying and fixing defects early is generally less expensive than addressing them in later stages or after the software is released. 

Enhanced Product Quality: By predicting and preventing defects, machine learning helps improve the overall quality of the software product. 

Resource Optimization: Machine learning models can analyze large datasets to prioritize testing efforts.

Continuous Improvement: Machine learning models can adapt and learn from new data over time.

Risk Mitigation: Identifying potential defects allows project managers to assess and mitigate risks associated with software development.

Efficiency Gains: Automation of defect prediction processes through machine learning contributes to increased efficiency in the development workflow.
